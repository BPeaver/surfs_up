# Surfs Up: Of Ice Cream and Surfboards

## Analysis

With any busiess, the goal is to thrive and be successful. One of the biggest goals of a new business is to achieve sustainability, and through that they will become successful. Few things go together as well as enjoying some cold ice cream on a nice warm day, and in a gorgeous locale like Oahu, its only natural that surfing can slot into that pairing with ease. 

Of course, surfing and ice cream really both benefit from warmer weather. Who wants to eat ice cream outside in the cold or ride some waves in frigid waters? To find out if Oahu is suitable for this concept, we took a look at the temperatures in June and December to see if there was a large difference between the summer time and winter in gorgeous Oahu. 

## Results

1: The month of June was warmer than December, as anyone in the Northern Hemisphere would expect during a summer month, with an average temperature of 74.9 degrees. This is a very comfortable temperature for enjoying some waves and some Rocky Road on a sandy beach. With a low temp of 64 and a high temp of 85, the month of June does run a bit of a swing in temperature throughout the day, as do most places in the world.

2: December, being a winter month, sees a dip in temperatures, however not as drastic as one might be accustumed to further north of the equator. With an average temperature of 71.04 degrees, the month is nearly 4 degrees cooler on average than the summer month of June, but still comfortable for outdoor activites. Notably, Decembers high temp of 83 is only 2 degrees less than Junes, though its low temp comes in at 8 degrees less (56 degrees), so you may need to wait a little later in the day to get some waves in (perfect time to put some fresh wax on your board or grab a waffle cone!).

3: We were able to pull data from several weather stations which yielded 1700 differet temperature readings for June (56.7 readings per day that month) and 1517 temperature readings for December (48.9 readings per day that month). This is plenty of data to give us a reliable look into what someone could expect on any given day temperature-wise in Oahu. 

## Summary

Overall, it's safe to say that Oahu is a great location for fairly consistent temperatures. With only a large difference in the lowest temperatures recorded, it's safe to say that any surfer or ice cream lover will be quite comfortable visiting our location in Oahu. 

However, this is not the only thing people look for when enjoying the beach. It would be beneficial to run queries to see what the average precipiation is for each month and if we could get a dataset that has information on average wave-heights as well to see if some months average out smaller waves or copious amounts of rain, which would kill our surfing vibes!
